## Background  

Golf can be complicated for new and even experienced players. From understanding obscure rules to tracking handicaps and interpreting course ratings, there’s a lot to remember — especially during play.  

**Problems Golfy Pal addresses:**  
* Confusion about golf rules in specific game situations  
* Manual or inconsistent handicap calculations  
* Lack of personalized learning and performance insights  
* Difficulty finding trusted golf-related information quickly  

I’ve spent years on the golf course and have seen players struggle with these same questions. Golfy Pal is my attempt to combine my passion for the game with the power of AI — making golf more accessible, fair, and fun for everyone.

## How is it used?  

Golfy Pal can be used on a smartphone or smartwatch during play or practice. Players can ask questions like:  
> “What’s the ruling if my ball lands in a water hazard?”  
> “What’s my course handicap at Gävle Golfbana from the white tees?”  
> “Give me a fun golf fact to share with my friends.”  

**Typical users:**  
* Amateur golfers  
* Golf club managers and coaches  
* New players learning the game 

**Usage context:**  
* On the course — quick rules or distance checks  
* At home — tracking stats or adjusting handicaps  
* In training — learning golf etiquette and rules through quizzes 
```


## Data sources and AI methods  

**Data sources:**  
* [USGA & R&A Rules of Golf Database](https://www.randa.org/)  
* [World Handicap System guidelines](https://www.whs.com/)  
* Historical golf data (tournament stats, course ratings, slope indexes)  
* User-provided round statistics and performance logs  

**AI methods used:**  
* Natural Language Processing (for understanding golf-related questions)  
* Knowledge graph or fine-tuned LLM for golf rules and facts  
* Simple regression or scoring model for handicap calculations  
* Recommendation engine for tips and game improvement suggestions  

| Component | Description |

## Challenges  

Golfy Pal won’t replace human judgment or official rulings. It’s designed for guidance, not enforcement.  

**Limitations:**  
* Rule interpretations depend on accurate user input  
* Course data must be up to date for precise handicap calculations  
* Requires internet access for AI features  

**Ethical considerations:**  
* Ensuring transparency in how handicaps are calculated  
* Avoiding unfair advantages in competitive settings  
* Respecting data privacy for users’ performance history

## What next?  

In the future, Golfy Pal could evolve into a **fully integrated golf assistant**:  
* Voice-activated companion integrated with GPS and shot tracking  
* AR overlays for course navigation and green reading  
* Integration with official handicap databases (e.g., Golf Genius, Min Golf)  
* Community features to share stats and compete with friends  

To move forward, I’d need:  
* Access to official course and slope data  
* Collaboration with local golf associations  
* Developers with experience in NLP and mobile app design
